# CS2610-Computer-Organization

- Simulated the working of a 5-stage Scalar Pipelined processor (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access,
Writeback) by designing a C++ program.
- The C++ program computes the Cycles per Instruction (CPI), Structural, Control Data Hazards.
- Designed a C++ Cache simulator that implements different Cache memory variations such as Set-Associative,
Fully-Associative and Direct- Mapped, and simultaneously enabling to utilize replacement policies such as
Random, LRU, Pseudo-LRU.
- The simulator computes the number of Cache reads, writes, Hit rate, Misses and the evicted dirty blocks.
